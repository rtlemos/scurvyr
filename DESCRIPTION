Title: Context-dependent space filling curves for gridded data with missing values
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Ricardo Lemos
Maintainer: Ricardo Lemos <rtl00@yahoo.com>
Description: Fit a 1D space-filling curve to a 2D image based on its spatial correlation properties.
    The result may be advantageous relative to universal algorithms such as the Peano and Hilbert SFCs.
    The algorithm has been tested on square and rectangular images of small to moderate size (360 x 720).
    A potentially interesting feature is that the algorithm can cope with patches of missing values in the image.
